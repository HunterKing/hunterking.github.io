            <p class="lead">Ethics case study blog post.  Share thoughts about the presentation and discussion of the Hive Tracks and Bee Informed Partnership case study.</p>
            <p>After having seen the Policies that Hive Tracks has in place, I have pretty good confidence about their abilities as well as their intent to protect their users. It proved that all three of the ethical topics we discussed (Privacy, Intellectual Property, and Security) are equally important and all of them have been considered. With regards to data, I think it was really reassuring that that is on a strictly opt-in basis for users. In that sense, the data that they generate can be treated both as their own intellectual property and remain private unless they expressly desire for it to no longer be. This is in pretty stark contrast to other companies out there, these days data is very much an opt-out process for most websites, and even after opting out it is oftentimes not complete, or comes with the caveat that they will still take some personalized information about you as a user. In addition, a really fascinating side-topic pertaining to honey integrity I found to be very crucial, that being that oftentimes the regulations that are imposed upon the agriculture industry are often pushed to the point of being worth less and less because of big-name agricultural companies, which is why there is a flood of so many terms that seem so similar to one another. In addition, the discussion of adding filler to honey in order to make it more cost-effective while still passing lab tests was a fascinating one which seems to be a trend in a lot of agricultural or pharmaceutical applications.
