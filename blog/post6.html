            <p class="lead">Make an entry in your blog discussing the most interesting thing you learned as a result of the blockchain videos/discussions.</p>
            <p>I thought that the most interesting thing discussed from blockchain is how widely applicable it is for more than cryptocurrency. Since it is an immutable ledger for any kind of transactions it is applicable for smart contracts across the entire spectrum of business, and I think that it can be a big technological player in the future of not just digital media but a ton of things. The supply chain example that we discussed was very interesting, I thought the application of walmart tracking down a contaminated food source very very quickly is something that is not at the surface of the discussion of blockchain, but could be the kind of application that really turns it from a technology for proof-of-concept digital money into a real moving force for real-world transactions (and consumer safety, in this circumstance). The new NFT phenomenon seems interesting too; I don’t think that I personally would be swayed by a digital asset that is “yours” in the sense you have the key to it on a blockchain. It seems weird to me because the assets that are being distributed this way are already accessible elsewhere, but I suppose it is intended to function in the same way that an art auction is, where there are images of the mona lisa everywhere but only one person can possess the real thing as their own object. While that makes sense for a collectors item online, a large concern of mine is with longevity for these things- blockchain is P2P which is sound to protect things from being “lost”, but with the way that cryptocurrency works, if a user loses their wallet.dat file they lose all of their crypto. I wonder if NFTs apply in the same way, and if they do, that means that they are a lot more fragile than any piece of physical art is.</p>
