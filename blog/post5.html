            <p class="lead">Make an entry in your blog describing your reaction to the information presented in the documentary Citizenfour? Did the documentary have an effect on your opinion of Edward Snowden or the US government?</p>
            <p>I think that the US Gov’t has a pretty long and storied history of doing things that are really questionable, and the Citizenfour documentary is more or less confirmation of that. I don’t know how to feel about Edward Snowden the person, but the data that he released I think is one of the biggest political events of the last 30 years. It is really important information, and information where not a whole lot has been tackled even since. I think on both sides of the fence there is no interest in getting rid of it and I don’t know that even if there was pressure from a president who was against it would get much done. The NSA seems to operate in the shadows, seemingly totally unaffected by the workings of the US justice system. In addition to the info that was shown in Citizenfour I think it’s really core to bring up the whole “Five Eyes” organization established between governments way back during WWII (and a lot of relics from that time, and especially the Cold War). A lot of these policies get passed under times when the fervor of nationalism is stirred up over great disasters (Pearl Harbor, 9/11) and result in the freedoms of people being taken away in a way that people don’t stop to consider until the dust clears and it becomes obvious that it is reflecting upon them and not outwardly anymore (e.g. PATRIOT act not stopping terrorists, but instead enabling all of this). I think that this is material that really needs to come up in every political conversation, and not something that is viewed as a moment in time in 2013, and I think that the distance that has been put between us and that event has only served to prove that these things can go on without getting stopped.
