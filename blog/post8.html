            <p class="lead">Make a final blog post describing the three most important things you learned this semester and offer one piece of advice to students taking the class next semester.</p>
            <p>I think that the three most important things that we discussed in class this semester are talking about the Ethical Systems we subscribe to, discussing the considerations of user privacy, intellectual property, and more that hivetracks has faced, and the privacy concerns related to the citizenfour film and just in a broad scope. </p>
            <p>Ethical systems are something that I think are really important because they can be foundational to the decision making choices of individuals, maybe more than they even expect them to. Furthermore, it is important to know with respect to the people around yourself because it is important to understand their perspective in how they may navigate tough situations, and to know that if they have a different viewpoint they may behave in a different way than you might expect, but it is not a failing so much as it is just a differing in personal systems.</p>
            <p>Hivetracks I think is a really interesting case study and it is something that I feel encapsulates the entire spectrum of conceivable problems with privacy, user security, intellectual property, and more. I found it to be really interesting to try and poke holes in it and discuss the more minute issues to really get a feel for how it is operated and just simply to know that each situation has been addressed in turn.</p>
            <p>I have been familiar with the Edward Snowden leaks since they happened back in 2013, however seeing the documentary about the events unfolding portrays them in a way that I think displays the scale of the problem a lot more effectively. It is shocking how little seems to have changed since those revelations came out, and I think that the problem that whole event indicates is people’s sheer complacency with surveillance when it is separated from them by a layer of abstraction. It is shocking how ok the average person is with being surveilled at an incredibly mass scale when they don’t see it happening, but the moment that you put the pressure on them directly it suddenly ceases to be acceptable. The whole thing is just kind of a bummer.</p>
            <p>Lastly, advice to an upcoming student. I think that the most important part of seminar is to just get into the experience. It is a lot lower-stakes than other classes that you take so you can definitely bring it down a little bit but I think that it is worth seriously considering each of the topics discussed in order to walk away from it with a better understanding. This is about the only class in the degree path that ventures outside of the academic world and into the business and private world, so I think that there are a lot of unique lessons to be learned before getting out of school and into work.</p>
