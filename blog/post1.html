            <p class="lead">Prompt: make an introductory blog post describing your best "in class" computing experience as a computer science student and your best "outside the class" computing experience during your time thus far as a computer science student.</p>
            <p>The best “in class computing experience” that I have had is the final program for our Intro to Computer Systems course. In that class, we had to write a disassembler for the LC-3 assembly programming language, in other words, converting assembly from raw binary into assembler directives (e.g. 0x1647 gets output as ADD R3, R1, R7). This was a lot of fun because it allowed me to really stretch my legs with the bitwise ops that we had been practicing all semester and it is a topic that is very exciting for me personally. I enjoyed it so much that I ended up getting the bulk of it done in one day, working a lot not because I had to get it done on time but just because I was really enjoying the experience. The fun that I had with that was a big inspiration for my partner and I’s capstone, where we attempted to implement a Game Boy z80 emulator from scratch.</p>
            <p> Out of class, I had a lot of fun in high school picking up Arch Linux for the first time. I found high school to be pretty uninspiring (who doesn’t?), and during study hall I could spend time tinkering and fixing busted packages instead of doing reading assignments. It was a really positive experience that allowed me to get a stronger grasp on the Linux fundamentals; I think that it was one of the things that made me want to write software, because some of the software on it was just totally busted. Every time I closed my laptop lid it would shut off the wifi driver without saying anything, and it wouldn’t restart until I flipped the physical toggle for the wireless card in the laptop off and on again. Getting the special laptop volume buttons working was a task in it’s own right too, and required a special tool that was available on the Arch User Repository (the name eludes me). All of those difficulties sort of demystifies the computer in a way that I think people outside of our field don't really get to experience; it’s the understanding that computers are the product of people and their time that makes them that much more exciting: I can do all of this, if I really set my mind to it.</p>
