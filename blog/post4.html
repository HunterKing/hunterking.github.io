            <p class="lead">Share your reaction to the TED Talks on Privacy or the exercises this week on privacy policies.</p>
            <p>I think that privacy is something that is increasingly important as it becomes increasingly fleeting. It is super valuable and people either don’t consider it or dismiss it. I really like the example that was used in the TED talk because it is one that I encounter every time I point it out to someone: I will tell them privacy is important, they’ll tell me “I don’t have anything to hide” and I have to start from square zero. It is really saddening to be in a position now where people feel that rather than being able to feel confident about it, retreat into saying that their life is so managed that they don’t have to hide their actions. That is a line I think is extremely frustrating because I think it’s super common and represents a ton of complacency by the average person. I worry that the concerns of privacy are well-meaning, but have been shoved down over time because of so many forces acting on it. In order to remain private, you have to inconvenience yourself, and when the invasions that happen are abstracted on a technical level they don’t even enter in the minds of people who are less-than-technical, which is really insidious because it pervades everyone’s lives.
